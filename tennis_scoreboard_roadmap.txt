Features : 
----------
I'm the referee. I can press 3 buttons : "Player 1 scored!", "Player 2 scored!", "Actual score ?"
[TODO : end of game ???]

Implement tennis rules, so we can follow a tennis match and get the score any time.


Roadmap : 
---------
#1 we need to get used with the language, start by implementing the tennis rules
 - func(actualScore, player1) --> newScore
 func({0, 0}, player1) --> {15, 0}
 func({0, 0}, player2) --> {0, 15}
 func({40, 40}, player2) --> {40, adv}
 func({40, adv}, player2) --> 

??? how to use goroutines and channels ????
---> send a message to some subscribers/write to the console (we can pretend it takes time to send a message), after each point ???

#2 implement an interface
a_player_scored(player1)

#3 make it talk to the network 
PUT /tennis/scored?player=player1 | PUT /tennis/scored?player=player2
GET /tennis/score






Tennis rules
------------
1. Each player can have either of these points in one game 0 15 30 40

2. If you have 40 and you win the ball you win the game, however there are special rules.

3. If both have 40 the players are deuce. 
 a. If the game is in deuce, the winner of a ball will have advantage and game ball. 
 b. If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game 
 c. If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.

Alt 1: 
4. First player wining a game, wins the match. 


Alt 2: 
4. Set is won after 6 games won (with a difference of 2 games). No tie-break.

5. First player wining a set, wins the match.
